Ever came across the [#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100daysofcode) challenge? Download a poster with 100 squares, print it out, cross one off every day and [don't break the chain!](https://blog.doist.com/dont-break-the-chain/) Benefits are inclusive of, but not limited to: 

- dopamine hit from physically crossing a day off (it's rather satisfactory 😌)
- visual reminder of your progress and commitment
